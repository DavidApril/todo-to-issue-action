## New Language Support

If you are interested in adding support for a new language, we encourage you to submit your contribution as a pull request if you are able. This approach is more likely to result in your changes being integrated into the codebase. Issues requesting new language support are welcome, but PRs are preferred.

## Writing Tests

When adding new language definitions, please refer to the current tests for the style to use. Your tests should be clear and concise, ensuring that they effectively validate your changes. For reference, check the existing tests in the `tests` directory.
